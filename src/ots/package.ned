package ots;
@namespace(ots);

// This package contains the connector to couple OMNeT++ and OpenTrafficSim (OTS)
// OpenTrafficSim is the traffic simulator developed by TU Delft, see https://opentrafficsim.org

// Code in this package is quite generic, i.e. it could be used by other OMNeT++ models as well.
// Please see the artery.ots package for the specific integration of OTS in Artery.
