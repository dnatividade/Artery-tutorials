Artery enables V2X simulations based on ETSI ITS-G5 protocols like GeoNetworking and BTP.
Single vehicles can be equipped with multiple ITS-G5 services through Artery's middleware, which also provides common Facilities for these services.
Some basic services, such as Cooperative Awareness (CAMs) and Decentralized Notification (DENMs), are already included.


## What is your medicine?

You may wonder what it is all about those medical terms about blood vessels in a technical environment.
Artery started as an extension of [Veins](https://veins.car2x.org), whose name derives from "Vehicles in Network
Simulation".
Veins has put emphasis on WAVE, the U.S. counterpart of ITS-G5, at least back in 2014 when development on Artery has
started.
Though Artery is not a fancy acronym, we thought it is a nice play on words because "arteries" are just related to
"veins" as is ITS-G5 to WAVE.
Please note that you can run Artery without Veins when you employ the radio model from [INET](https://inet.omnetpp.org).
