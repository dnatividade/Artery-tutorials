Some suggestions for further reading beyond Artery's documentation which may be helpful for you.

- [Recent Advances in Network Simulation: The OMNeT++ Environment and its Ecosystem](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-12842-5)
    - Section 12 describes how to create a custom ITS service and the *highway-police* scenario in particular
    - Section 13 deals with LTE-based vehicular communication, see our *lte-blackice* scenario
- [SUMO Documentation](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/)  
    - [SUMO File Extensions](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Other/File_Extensions.html) can be used to identify files which belong to SUMO
    - [TraCI](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/TraCI.html) is about SUMO's data exchange interface used by Artery
    - [Road Networks](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Networks/SUMO_Road_Networks.html) and [Demand Modelling](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Demand/Introduction_to_demand_modelling_in_SUMO.html) are useful starting points for creating custom maps and traffic
- [OMNeT++ Documentation](https://omnetpp.org/documentation/)  
    Also have a look at the files at `omnetpp-<VERSION>/doc/` in your local OMNet++ installation directory.
    While the linked online version is always up-to-date, the local copy matches your particular OMNeT++ version.
